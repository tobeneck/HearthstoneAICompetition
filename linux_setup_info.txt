Setup:

1. Get Visual Studio Code and install the C# addon

2. Install ".Net Core", explained on the microsoft webside: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu

2. (should already be done here)
   Add a line to "core-extensions/HSGrammar/HSGrammar.csproj", to set up the java environment variable:

   <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

   <PropertyGroup>
     <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
     <Antlr4JavaExecutable>/usr/bin/java</Antlr4JavaExecutable> //<- line to add
     <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
   ...

3. There are variables in the Program.cs that might need to be changed for training:
   * set the train variable in TestPOGame in Program.cs to true
   * change the "outputFile" variable in Program.TestPOGame() to your output file path



Build (for Linux only):

 * run "dotnet build -r linux-x64" in the root directory of the project. (or "dotnet publish --runtime linux-x64")
 * building always results whits an error for me, but does build anyway, so i guess its fine



Run:

 * The build Program is in "HearthstoneAICompetition/core-extensions/SabberStoneBasicAI/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/linux-x64/SabberStoneAICompetition"
